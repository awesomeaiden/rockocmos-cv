OCR of Russian characters with OpenCV for Russian final project

This project includes various scripts that I used when learning OpenCV, in addition to more pertinent files that are actually used for OCR using OpenCV.

*genData.py* is what is used to generate the KNN dataset (classifications and flattened images of characters).  *trainTest.py* is where the KNN model is actually trained on the dataset and tested with an input image.

I used a few tutorials and other open source repositories to make this project happen:
- [OpenCV 3 KNN Character Recognition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c96w1JS28AY)
- [KNN Algorithm Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HKqjENq9OU)
